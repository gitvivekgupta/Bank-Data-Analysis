# Bank-Data-Analysis

Assumptions:

-> Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.
-> For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.
-> Only the meaningful variables should be included.
-> The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.
-> The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
-> Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.

Our prediction will be based on the customerâ€™s 
1> job 
2> marital status
3> whether he/she has credit in default
4> whether he/she has a housing loan
5> whether he/she has a personal loan 
6> outcome of the previous marketing campaigns.
