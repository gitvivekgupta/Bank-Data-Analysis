# Bank-Data-Analysis

Assumptions:

-> Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.<br/>
-> For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.<br/>
-> Only the meaningful variables should be included.<br/>
-> The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.<br/>
-> The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.<br/>
-> Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.

Objective: 

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). <br/>

Our prediction will be based on the customerâ€™s <br/>
